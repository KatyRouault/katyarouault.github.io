<h1>Who is Katy Rouault?</h1>
<p class="aboutp">Hi, I'm Katy Rouault and I'm origanlly from Fort Collins Colorado. I grew up in the same home my whole life surrounded by my parents and three older brothers.
    Before college I had many hobbies including cheerleading, cooking, and working out. I cheered for 11 years of my life and it taught me many things like leadership and compassion.
    Cooking with my family was a newer hobbie at the end of highschool and I learned to cook healthy food for my self. I have always loved working out but I got into it a lot more after cheer and it truly is something that replaced it. 
    The hobbie I loved most was crafting, any chance I had to do a fun home craft I would take. Whether it was for a birthday or holiday or just new room decor I never hesitate to make it myself. I think all
    of these thing lead to where I am today hoping to be a UX/UI designer. I love math and crafts so what better major than Creative Technology and Design In Engineering.
    I began taking more classes I'm intrested in my sophmore year and I can't wait to take UX 1 my junior year fall. I'm currently looking for summer interships with any company, 
    but hoopefully an engineering consulting company would be ideal. This is because I would then be able to work with multiple engineering companies and learn what I like to work with the more. 
    I'm also currently in a sorority at CU and right now I live in the house. It has taught me patience as I live with 86 girls and still have a roommate. But I have so many lifelong friendship and connections now. 
    Past jobs I have had is nannying and a teller at a bank. Both of these take a lot of patience and people skills so I definitley feel very well trained in both of those areas. When I worked at the bank it was very new to me 
    I had done nothing like it before but it was such a good learning expierence. More of these skills are on my resume to look at.
